"""
You must implement a test executable named test.py that imports your framework and
• Generates a training and a test set of 1000 points sampled uniformly in [0, 1]^2, each with a
label 0 if outside the disk centered at (0.5, 0.5) of radius 1/sqrt(2*pi), and 1 inside,
• builds a network with two input units, one output unit, three hidden layers of 25 units,
• trains it with MSE, logging the loss,
• computes and prints the final train and the test errors.
